### **Connect to Database**

Establish a connection to the Microsoft SQL Server using the `connect` method with customizable parameters:

```dart
bool isConnected = await mssqlConnection.connect(
  ip: 'your_server_ip',
  port: 'your_server_port',
  databaseName: 'your_database_name',
  username: 'your_username',
  password: 'your_password',
  timeoutInSeconds: 15,
);

// `isConnected` returns true if the connection is established.
```

---

### **Get Data**

Fetch data from the database using the `getData` method:

```dart
String query = 'SELECT * FROM your_table';
String result = await mssqlConnection.getData(query);

// `result` contains data in JSON format.
```

---

### **Write Data**

Perform insert, update, or delete operations using the `writeData` method:

```dart
String query = 'UPDATE your_table SET column_name = "new_value" WHERE condition';
String result = await mssqlConnection.writeData(query);

// `result` contains details about the operation, e.g., affected rows.
```

---

### **Disconnect**

Close the database connection when it's no longer needed:

```dart
bool isDisconnected = await mssqlConnection.disconnect();

// `isDisconnected` returns true if the connection was successfully closed.
```
